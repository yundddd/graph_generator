# Modeling pipelines

This subfolder contains notebooks with GNN modeling (training and evaluation) pipelines:
- `Create_PyG_Dataset.ipynb` contains an implementation of a PyG dataset class created using data produced by the graph executor.
- `GNN_models.ipynb` contains our initial modeling pipeline for experimenting with GNN models on the simulated graph dataset.
- `GNN_temporal_models.ipynb` contains the modeling pipeline for spatial and spatiotemporal models. This notebook can be run in Google colab. Results from this notebook are shown in our Medium blogpost.
